basic -> 6 categories, 25 tabs

pro -> list plus elabor√©e + filtres + conseils





@upgrade-prompt.js What feature can I put behind a paywall, I want to secure premium features (not hackable). Take in consideration user privacy, for example, for the categorization of tabs, only send (to a future API) the hostname of the tab instead of the entire url that can contain sensible data, so we can't put duplicate tab feature behind a paywall because we save only the hostname.

how to secure thoses features correctly ?
