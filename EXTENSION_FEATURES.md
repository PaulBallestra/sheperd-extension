## üöÄ Core Engine: The Real-Time Revolution

This is the flagship capability of Sheperd, setting it apart from all other tab managers. The entire extension is built on a real-time, event-driven architecture.

-   **True Real-Time Synchronization**:
    -   **Instantaneous Updates**: Any action in the browser‚Äîopening, closing, or switching tabs‚Äîis instantly reflected in the extension UI without any delay or need for a manual refresh.
    -   **Optimistic UI**: Actions performed within the extension (like closing a tab) appear to happen instantly, providing a seamless and fluid user experience. The action is confirmed with the browser in the background.
    -   **Live Counters**: All numerical data, such as the total tab count, category counts, and duplicate counts, update in real-time as you browse.
    -   **Bulletproof State Management**: An advanced state management system with operation snapshots ensures that if a browser action fails, the UI can gracefully roll back, preventing any data inconsistency.

## üß† Smart Tab Organization

Sheperd automates tab organization, removing the manual effort typically required by users.

-   **Automatic Smart Categorization**:
    -   **Zero-Effort Sorting**: Tabs are automatically classified into logical categories (e.g., `Work`, `Social`, `Shopping`, `Dev`, `Entertainment`, `Other`) based on their domain and content.
    -   **Context-Aware Grouping**: The categorization engine intelligently clusters related sites, understanding the context of your browsing session.
-   **Live Duplicate Tab Detection**:
    -   **Real-Time Duplication Count**: The extension actively monitors and displays a live count of any duplicate tabs you have open.
    -   **One-Click Smart Removal**: Close all duplicate tabs with a single click, keeping the original tab intact.

## üî• Real-Time Performance Analytics & Optimization

Sheperd provides live insights into your browser's performance, empowering you with the data and tools to optimize it instantly.

-   **Live Performance Monitoring**:
    -   **Resource Impact Score**: A real-time scoring system (`Light`, `Medium`, `Heavy`) visualizes the current performance impact of your open tabs.
    -   **Loaded vs. Total Tabs**: See a live count of actively running tabs versus total open tabs (e.g., "12/47 loaded"), giving you a clear picture of active memory usage.
    -   **Heavy Site Detection**: The system identifies and flags resource-intensive domains like Figma or YouTube in real-time.
-   **Dynamic Optimization Tools**:
    -   **Smart Suggestions**: Receive context-aware recommendations that update as you browse, such as "Close 5 idle tabs to save ~200MB RAM".
    -   **One-Click Optimization**: Act on performance suggestions with a single click for instant browser improvements.

## ‚ö° Powerful Tab Management Actions

Sheperd provides a suite of powerful actions to manage tabs efficiently, all with instant feedback.

-   **Bulk Operations**:
    -   **Close Entire Categories**: Clean up your workspace by closing all tabs within a specific category with one click.
    -   **Bookmark Categories**: Save an entire category of tabs into a new, organized bookmark folder.
-   **Individual Tab Management**:
    -   **Quick Actions**: From the extension UI, you can directly close, switch to, or bookmark any individual tab.

## üìä Gamified UI & User Experience

The user interface is designed to be intuitive, informative, and engaging.

-   **The Sheperd Level System**:
    -   **Live Tab Meter**: A gamified "Sheperd Meter" changes its level and displays encouraging (or warning!) messages based on your live tab count.
    -   **5 Levels of Tab Hygiene**: From "üåü Looking sharp!" for a clean slate to "üî• Tab apocalypse!" for tab overload, the meter provides instant, fun feedback.
    -   **Dynamic Animations**: The meter and its associated levels animate smoothly as you open and close tabs.
-   **Modern & Clean Interface**:
    -   **Expandable Category Views**: Categories are neatly organized in expandable sections that show tab favicons, titles, and live counts.
    -   **Smooth & Responsive**: The UI is built with smooth CSS animations and transitions for a polished, modern feel.
    -   **Performance-Optimized**: The interface is designed to be lightweight and performant, even with over 100 tabs open.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Foundation

These architectural choices are what make the real-time experience possible.

-   **Manifest V3 Service Worker**: A persistent background service worker that monitors all Chrome tab events (`onCreated`, `onRemoved`, `onUpdated`) to trigger real-time updates.
-   **Component-Based ES6 Architecture**: A modern, modular frontend design ensures the UI is reusable, maintainable, and efficient.
-   **Custom Real-Time Event System**: A sophisticated system with over 20 unique events allows for highly specific and efficient UI updates, avoiding unnecessary re-renders of the entire interface.
